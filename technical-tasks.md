# GSG Code Academy Application: Technical Tasks

In order to be considered for the in person technical interview, **you must complete the following Coding and Typing tasks**. We will consider the completion and quality of ALL of these tasks when we make decisions on who to invite for the in-person interview.

The coding section is by far the longest section and will require the most time to complete.

**It will take time to complete these lessons.** We suggest having a consistent schedule over a few weeks to complete these lessons. If you ever get stuck or feel overwhelmed, ask for help on the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/TjzYPC6FfC), or drop by one of our campuses in person. We are very happy to help.

## Typing:

Typing is very important skill in life and especially in coding. If you are a good typist you will find learning to code much, much easier.

Join the GSG classroom on TypingClub, using **the same email address you used in you GSG Code Academy application**. If you do not use the same email address we will not know your score.

3- Copy and paste this code `GMUR84A` then click Sign up after that you can fill in your information

By the application deadline, you must **complete at least the first 50 lessons in Typing Club**.

Each lesson should take less than 10 minutes to complete. The best way to improve your typing is to do a small amount, practising every day, rather than doing all of the lessons at once.

## Coding:

Complete the following lessons, which are an introduction to Front End Web Development. **You should make sure you take the time to read and fully understand the concepts, and not just rush through to complete the challenges**.

The lessons have been carefully curated from amazing, open-source teaching resources - most notably [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

We have intentionally organized the orders of the steps in a way to structure your learning. We highly recommend that you follow the steps in the order they are listed.

In the in-person technical interview you will be asked questions to check your knowledge and skills in these topics. **You will be tested on your general understanding of concepts, specific coding questions, and your understanding of your project code.** The best way to prepare for the in-person technical interview is by **completing these lessons thoroughly and honestly (i.e. no copying and pasting from Google!)**
