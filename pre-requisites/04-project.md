# HTML & CSS project

## Introduction

Your website is your application. You need to tell us about yourself and why you are applying for this program. Your website also needs to demonstrate your capabilities in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Feel free to get creative with the implementation—as long as you meet all the criteria below you can have fun with it.

## Criteria 
### General criteria 
Your website must meet the following criteria:

- [ ] All code is written by you
- [ ] No external libraries (e.g. no Bootstrap, React, or GitHub Pages themes, but external fonts/icons are fine).
- [ ] Tell us about yourself and your contact information.
- [ ] Tells us why you are applying for the program
- [ ] Your Github repository should be public
- [ ] Hosted on GitHub Pages
- [ ] Links back to the GitHub repository that contains the code for your site
- [ ] Links to your public freeCodeCamp profile
- [ ] Links to your CodeWars profile.
- [ ] Present your assigned JavaScript project and any other previous works.
 
### Technical criteria 
To demonstrate your learning your site must have at least one example of each of these:

- [ ]  Semantic HTML5 elements
- [ ]  CSS grid or flexbox layout (or both)
- [ ]  DOM event listeners for user interaction (e.g. click, keydown)
- [ ]  DOM updates in response to user interaction (e.g. showing/hiding an element, changing text or styles)
 
### Examples 
Here are some examples of optional features you could add to your site to meet all the above technical requirements. These are just examples—we encourage you to be creative and make something you find fun and interesting.

* Image carousel
    A slideshow of images with previous/next arrow buttons that show/hide the next image in a list.
* Tabs
    A set of tabs to show/hide different sections of the page when clicked.
* Theme toggle
    A button that lets you switch between different style themes (e.g. light/dark).
